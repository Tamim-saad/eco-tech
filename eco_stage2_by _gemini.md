### **Slide 1: Title & Hook**

* **Visual:** The Eco-Tech Hackathon 2026 logo , your team name (Alpha Verse), and the project title: **NodiWatch: AI-Powered Satellite Surveillance for River Ecosystems**.  
* \+1  
* **Script (approx. 15 seconds):** "Hello judges, we are Team Alpha Verse. We are here to present NodiWatch, a solution to a silent, double-blind crisis destroying Bangladesh's river ecosystems."

### **Slide 2: 1\. Problem Statement**

* **Visual:** Split screen showing clustered factories on one side and an encroached, narrowed river on the other. Include logos of the Dept. of Environment (DoE) and National River Conservation Commission (NRCC) as target stakeholders.  
* **Script (approx. 40 seconds):** "Our rivers face two massive threats. First, the Accountability Gap: When multiple factories cluster together, pinpointing the exact source of pollution is nearly impossible, preventing legal action. Second, Silent Encroachment or 'Nodi Dokhol': Illegal land filling is incremental and often goes undetected until river flows are permanently altered. Current manual inspections are reactive, dangerous, and lack the historical evidence needed for environmental courts. Our primary stakeholders, the DoE and NRCC, desperately need a proactive, time-series solution."

### **Slide 3: 2\. Proposed Solution & 4\. Features/Applicability**

* **Visual:** A mock-up of the NodiWatch web dashboard showing the "Dual Heatmaps" (red for pollution, yellow for encroachment).  
* **Script (approx. 45 seconds):** "Enter NodiWatch. We are building an AI-powered satellite surveillance system that processes 10 years of Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery in the cloud. Our platform provides dual features: pollution fingerprinting and encroachment detection. It flags hotspots as color-coded risk zones, assigns probability scores to nearby industries using proximity matching, and detects shoreline shrinkage. By exporting automated evidence reports and sending alerts for sudden spikes, we allow authorities to prioritize high-risk inspections instantly."

### **Slide 4: 3\. AI / Modern Technology Integration**

* **Visual:** A simple flowchart showing Satellite Data $\\rightarrow$ Two-Layer AI $\\rightarrow$ Actionable Dashboard. Mention tools: Google Earth Engine, TensorFlow, PostGIS.  
* **Script (approx. 40 seconds):** "Our technical core relies on a two-layer AI approach. Layer one is an Image Segmentation CNN that tracks water pixels over time to detect river boundary changes. Layer two is a Random Forest Classifier trained on spectral signatures—it identifies high Red/Blue ratios for textile dyes, turbidity for tanneries, and thermal spikes for power plants. A Bayesian probability model then ranks nearby factories by the likelihood of being the polluter, transforming raw geospatial data into actionable intelligence."

### **Slide 5: 5\. Market Opportunity**

* **Visual:** Large numbers indicating the scale (e.g., number of rivers in Bangladesh, number of industrial units).  
* **Script (approx. 30 seconds):** "The market opportunity for environmental regulatory tech is massive. In Bangladesh alone, thousands of industrial units sit on riverbanks. Our primary market is B2G—equipping government bodies to save millions in inefficient, reactive inspection costs. Secondarily, there is a growing B2B market for Banks and Financial Institutions who need automated due diligence tools to enforce 'Green Banking' policies and deny loans to flagged polluters."

### **Slide 6: 6\. Business Model**

* **Visual:** Three pillars: Government Licensing, B2B API, Public Portal.  
* **Script (approx. 30 seconds):** "Our business model is a multi-tier SaaS approach. Tier 1 involves annual licensing to government bodies like the DoE for continuous regional monitoring. Tier 2 is a pay-per-query API model for financial institutions needing environmental compliance checks on corporate clients. Tier 3 is a freemium public dashboard, enabling citizen photo validation for ground-truthing while building public trust."

### **Slide 7: 7\. Environmental & Social Impact**

* **Visual:** Icons representing law enforcement, historical data, and flood prevention.  
* **Script (approx. 35 seconds):** "The impact is profound. NodiWatch enables dual enforcement—catching polluters and land grabbers simultaneously. By providing 10 years of historical satellite evidence, we give environmental courts the legal-grade proof they need. Socially, identifying encroached sections allows authorities to guide riverbank restoration, directly reducing urban flooding risks for vulnerable communities."

### **Slide 8: 8\. Prototype Stage & Development Roadmap**

* **Visual:** A 4-week timeline timeline graphic.  
* **Script (approx. 35 seconds):** "We are currently at the Early Prototype stage, having validated our core concepts in Google Earth Engine. Our roadmap for the next 4 weeks includes:  
  * **Weeks 1-2:** Refining our AI spectral fingerprinting models using DoE ground-truth data.  
  * **Weeks 2-3:** Developing the full React/NextJs interactive dashboard and integrating the automated alert system.  
  * **Weeks 3-4:** Launching a focused pilot program specifically on a high-risk zone, like the Buriganga or Dhaleshwari river."

### **Slide 9: 9\. Team Introduction**

* **Visual:** Photos of your team members with their roles (e.g., AI Developer, Geospatial Analyst, Strategy).  
* **Script (approx. 15 seconds):** "We are Team Alpha Verse. Our background in \[mention your fields, e.g., computer science, data analytics, and environmental engineering\] makes us uniquely equipped to bridge the gap between technology and ecology."

### **Slide 10: Conclusion**

* **Visual:** "Innovate for Green" tagline with contact info.  
* **Script (approx. 15 seconds):** "With NodiWatch, we aren't just watching the rivers; we are giving them a voice in court. Thank you to Environment Watch: BUET for this opportunity. We are ready to Innovate for Green."
