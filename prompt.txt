Page 1: "Catching Polluters, Land Grabbers & Predicting Erosion from Space", change the line. make this line problem specifc and use appropiate keyword to attract the judge. add bangla word, (in seperate line smartly), "nodi dushon", "nodi dokhol", "nodi vangon"
Page 2: add "nodi dushon" along with nodi dokhol and nodi vangon keywords. so modify option ① The Accountability Gap. so it follows the same style like other 2. (also update anywhere in the presentation, that needs to be updated for this)
also for the keywords "nodi vangon", "nodi dokhol", "nodi dushon": always maintain english translation when you are writing it in english, never use banglish. (everywhere in the presentartion).
update the cards "2500+", "10000 ha" etc. make it more attractive and professional (do not add more. modify them to better keyword or statistics)
Page 3: add them smartly. if you can add them in existing cards, else create extra
```Expand 'Legal & NGOs': Add specific environmental organizations like BAPA, RDRC, and Waterkeepers Bangladesh. Note that they will use NodiWatch’s satellite evidence for policy advocacy and public awareness.
Add 'International Organizations': Include World Bank, ADB, and UNDP as stakeholders who require this data to monitor the progress of environmental development projects they fund.```
Page 4: Update the page. explain it well. if needed use 2 page for this '② Proposed Solution'

Page 7: take context from modified page 3 and update this paeg like 
```B2I (Business to International) / Global Research: "International organizations (World Bank, UNDP, ADB) and global RMG buyers need precise ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data to ensure green compliance."```
Page 8: review the business model based on updates. and try to segmentise "free" and "paid". analyze yourself and update accordingly. if needed create 2 page
